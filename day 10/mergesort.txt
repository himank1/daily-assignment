Step 1: Find the middle index of the array.
        Middle = 1 + (last â€“ first)/2
Step 2: Divide the array from the middle.
Step 3: Call merge sort for the first half of the array
        MergeSort(array, first, middle)
Step 4: Call merge sort for the second half of the array.
        MergeSort(array, middle+1, last)
Step 5: Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.
