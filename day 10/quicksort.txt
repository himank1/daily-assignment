Step 1 − Choose the index value as pivot
Step 2 − Take two variables to point left and right of the list excluding pivot
Step 3 − left points to the low index and right points to the high
Step 4 − Now apply quick sort again to the left side of the index value 
Step 5 − similarly apply quick sort to the right side of index value also
Step 6 - so we will do the same as, if the value is smaller than the index value then move it to left
         and if it is greater then move it to the right side of the index value.
Step 7 − Now we repeat step 5 and step 6 until both the left and right dosn't get completely sorted 
Step 8 − if left ≥ right, the point where they met is new pivot
